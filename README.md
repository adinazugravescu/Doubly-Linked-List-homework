# Doubly-Linked-List-homework
The implementation of the assignment is done using 2 source files (a header file and a file containing the main function) and a Makefile used for compiling the sources, creating the executable, running it, and deleting it.

The header file, "tema1.h," contains the definition of structures (for the tape, a doubly linked list with a sentinel node and a "finger" aka the current node, for the stack - TStack, and for the queue - TQueue), as well as several functions:
-> functions that will implement the operations required (UPDATE, QUERY, UNDO/DO, EXECUTE);
-> functions for processing abstract data types (for the doubly linked list, we have a function for creating a node in the list, one for initializing this particular type of list, and one for deallocating memory; for the stack, we have functions for initialization, checking if the stack is empty, inserting a new element, removing from the stack, and deallocating memory; for the queue, we have functions for initialization and freeing a node, initializing the queue, checking if it is empty, adding and removing elements, finding the first value, and freeing memory).

In "tema1.c," the tape will be represented by the List variable, the stack for UNDO operations by stackU, the stack for REDO operations by stackR, and the queue for EXECUTE operations by the queue variable. By reading from the "tema1.in" file, we first have the number of operations in the variable n, then we read each line containing a command into an inputCharacters variable, based on which multiple tape operations will be performed. If the command is not of type EXECUTE, we handle two cases: the UPDATE type, which will be added to the queue, and the on-spot execution case, which involves two variants - QUERY and UNDO/REDO. QUERY results in calling the show and show_current functions, while UNDO and REDO involve filling and emptying the stacks with the addresses of the current last node, according to the requirements. If the command is of type EXECUTE, then we sequentially perform the UPDATE operations by calling the implemented functions for them in tema1.h. Finally, we deallocate the list and close the input and output files.
